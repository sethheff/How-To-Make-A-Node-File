# How-To-Make-A-Node-File
Install Node
We will use Homebrew to install Node via the command line.

1. update Homebrew with the latest version of Node
brew update

2. install Node on your machine (this may take a few minutes)
brew install node

3. verify that Node was installed by checking the version that is on your machine
node -v


Setting up a Node Project
1. Create a new folder for your first node project.
mkdir my-first-node-proj

Open the folder in your favorite text editor.

2. Initialize Node inside the project folder.
(check the command line prompt to make sure you're actually inside the project folder)
npm init

You will be prompted to enter values for a number of fields to set up the node project. You can just press enter to accept the default value, or enter specific values if you'd like.

To skip this step in the future (and accept all default values at once), type npm init -y.

Take a look at the package.json file that was just created. This is where the values we just set up via npm init are stored. This is like your settings file. You can edit these values by changing them in this file (make sure to save).

3. Make your entry point.

Unless you specified a different file name in setup (check the main value in package.json), Node will look for a file called index.js as the entry point for running your project. This file holds the code to be executed - this is the heart of your program. Create this file now.
touch index.js

Let's write some code in here and run it to see Node in action! Write the following line to your index.js:
console.log("Hello world!")

4. Run your program!

To run a file in node via the command line, type node [file name here].
node index.js
Congratulations, you've created and run your first Node program! Let's learn more about how Node is used in the wild (and eventually, in the web-development context).


HOW TO CREATE AN EXPRESS APP 

1. CD into your directory and run.. npm init -y to create a json file inside our document.

then from your local terminal, run 

2. npm i express to install express

once installed, it will add a 'dependencies' object in your json file. It tells you what your express version is. It also adds a package-lock.json file which contains the files needed for express.

Your node_modules file is too big to upload all the time. Because of this we want to add a new file called .gitignore

3. add .gitignore file and add (in plain text) the name of the files you dont want to send to git .

4. add node_modules to .gitignore

5. To add a hello world home route write,,,

'''
app.get('/', (req,res)=>{
    res.send('Hello, World!')
    
})

app.listen(8000, () =>{
    console.log("You're listening to the smooth sounds of port 8000.")
})
'''

app.get(,) is how you connect to the domain you want (ie localhost:8000), after working on a local server in private

the '/' portion of the app.get file is called a URL route

example: https://www.reddit.com (= base url) /search (= url pattern) ?q=cute%20puppies (= url string)
